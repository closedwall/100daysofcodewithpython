#welcome to [#100DaysOfCode]() with Python
## What is #100DaysOfCode?

\#100DaysOfCode is a challenge where I commit to coding for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days. The goal is to build a consistent coding habit, improve programming skills, and work on meaningful projects.

## Why Python?

I've chosen Python as my primary language for this challenge because of its versatility, readability, and the vast array of applications it supports ‚Äì from web development to data science.
