#welcome to [#100DaysOfCode]() with Python
## What is #100DaysOfCode?

\#100DaysOfCode is a challenge where I commit to coding for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days. The goal is to build a consistent coding habit, improve programming skills, and work on meaningful projects.

## Why Python?

I've chosen Python as my primary language for this challenge because of its versatility, readability, and the vast array of applications it supports ‚Äì from web development to data science.

## Day 19: Turtle Racing Game

Today's progress involved a deep dive into Turtle Graphics, exploring states, event listeners, and higher-order functions. The highlight of the day was the creation of a Turtle Racing Game using the Turtle Graphics library.

### Key Learnings

- **Turtle Graphics:** Explored the basics of Turtle Graphics, including turtle movements, shapes, and colors.
- **States in Turtle Graphics:** Manipulated turtle states like penup and pendown for drawing and non-drawing movements.
- **Event Listeners:** Implemented event listeners to capture user input, enabling the turtle to respond to specific actions.
- **Higher-Order Functions:** Gained insights into the concept of higher-order functions and applied them in the Turtle Racing Game.

### Project: Turtle Racing Game

- Multiple turtles(5) participate in a race on the Turtle Graphics window.
- Users can place bets on the turtle they think will win.
- Turtles move forward randomly, and the first one to reach the finish line is declared the winner.
