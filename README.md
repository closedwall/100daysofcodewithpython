#welcome to [#100DaysOfCode]() with Python
## What is #100DaysOfCode?

\#100DaysOfCode is a challenge where I commit to coding for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days. The goal is to build a consistent coding habit, improve programming skills, and work on meaningful projects.

## Why Python?

I've chosen Python as my primary language for this challenge because of its versatility, readability, and the vast array of applications it supports ‚Äì from web development to data science.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Tkinter for an intuitive and easy-to-use GUI.


### Usage

1. **Enter Website**: Input the name of the website.
2. **Enter Email/Username**: Provide the associated login email or username.
3. **Generate Password**: Click the `Generate Password` button to create a strong password.
4. **Save Credentials**: Click `Add` to store the credentials in `password.txt`.
5. **Copy to Clipboard**: The password is automatically copied for convenience.

### Security Considerations

- The passwords are saved in a plain-text file (`password.txt`). Consider encrypting or using a database for better security.
- Avoid sharing your saved file with others to prevent unauthorized access.
